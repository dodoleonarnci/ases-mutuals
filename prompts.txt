With the help of AI tools like cursor, recommend a framework for a webapp that matches college students with people they don't know but share a mutual friend. The website contains the following: 1. Very stylistic and dynamic landing page to attract college students to sign up 2. Account system with initial survey asking for hobbies etc. 3. IMPORTANT: integrates iMessages to collect names of closest contacts 4. Automatic email sending in school's Outlook network to notify weekly friend matches 5. Very simple server database to store student info 6. A robust matching algorithm that supports matching 1000+ students that calculates how close two students are based on given info 7. The website should work very well on phones and ipads. In fact, it will primarily be visited through mobile. My team only has backend coding experience and has no web dev experience whatsoever. Keep that in mind. Now recommend a framework and also sketch out a rough plan on how to implement each of the given items.
