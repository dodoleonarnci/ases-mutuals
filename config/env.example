# Client-side API key (exposed to browser - use same value as API_KEY for frontend access)
# NOTE: Exposing API keys in client-side code is a security risk. Only use this if:
# - The API is meant for internal/admin use only
# - You understand that anyone can view the key in the browser's developer tools
# - You have additional security measures in place (e.g., IP whitelisting, rate limiting)
